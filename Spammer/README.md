This program will read from a .txt file, typing the contents of that file wherever you want, and pressing "enter" after
it has finished typing every line or word.

Lines 9-12 exist in case you want to type every word in the "message.txt" file. If you want to type every line in the
.txt file, simply change the parameter on line 11 from "line" to "word"

Thanks, bye.
